         <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
         <p>Our project is centered around the design and development of a high-performance water rocket system,
         driven entirely by compressed air. Water rockets have long been a staple in educational environments, but
         current learning kits and documentation often fall short of modern expectations. This initiative aims to
         revamp the learning experience for A-level and first-year undergraduate engineering students by delivering
         a cutting-edge educational kit. The rocket will not only demonstrate essential engineering principles but will
        also serve as a platform for innovation in design, prototyping, and team-based project execution.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="project-col">
         <h3>The Mission</h3>
         <p>As a newly established consultancy, we’ve teamed up with Rocket-Education to rethink how water rocket
         technology can engage and inspire future engineers. Our goal is to create a high-quality, affordable, and
         easy-to-use educational kit that teachers can seamlessly integrate into their classrooms or labs. 
            With a strong focus on accessibility and
         sustainability, the kit will include options for 3D-printed parts, low-cost materials, and even recycled
         components—all while upholding a professional level of engineering and design.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="project-col">
         <h3>Collaboration and Goals</h3>
         <p>This project is designed to mirror real-world engineering practices, with team members rotating roles, hitting
         key milestones, and maintaining clear documentation throughout. As we work toward the final Test Event in
         May 2024, our goal is to deliver a rocket that not only looks great and flies high, but is also safe and reliable.
         With a strong focus on teamwork, affordability, and educational impact, the project pushes our technical
         skills while giving us space to be creative, enjoy the process, and make a meaningful contribution to STEM 
         learning.</p>
